QuantLib Cython wrappers
========================

This library is a thin wrapper using Cython on top of QuantLib. 
It currently focuses on useful simple objects like Date, Calendar but
might be extended to more complex wrappers if needed.

This work is based on QuantLib version 1.0.1.

Still not working with 10.04
